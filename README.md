### Testing Instructions for the To-Do List Software

#### Overview
This tutorial offers short methods to fully test the `localStorage} integration, usability, edge cases, and functionality of the To-Do List application.


#### Functional Testing 
1. **Please add a task. Make that the task you entered is visible in the list.**
   
2. **Delete Task** - Take a task out of the list and make sure it vanishes.
   
3. **Complete Task** - Check that the user interface refreshes when a task is marked as completed.
   
4. **Filter Tasks** - Verify that the list refreshes successfully by testing filtering by "All," "Completed," and "Incomplete" tasks.
   
5. **Sort Tasks** - Check that the task titles are sorted in both "Ascending" and "Descending" order.

#### {localStorage} Integration 
1. **Persistence** - Reload the application, add tasks, and make sure they continue.
   
2. **Data Integrity** - Include, remove, and finish tasks before reloading to
